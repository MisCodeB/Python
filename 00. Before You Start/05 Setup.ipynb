It’s worth noticing that the more recent versions of pip can handle external dependencies using [wheels](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/), but, by using Anaconda, you’ll be able to install critical libraries for data science more smoothly.

Also, Conda is an environment manager, so if you need a package that requires a different version of Python, by using Conda, it is possible to set up a separate environment with a totally different version of Python, maintaining your usual version of Python on your default environment."
