Imperative programming is a paradigm describing **HOW** the program should do something by explicitly specifying each instruction (or statement) step by step, which mutate the program's state.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This \"what vs how\" is often used to compare both of these approaches because...

So in a way, **declarative programming is a layer of abstraction on top of imperative programming**.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The transformation from declarative to \"imperative code\" is generally made by engines, interpreters, or compilers. For example, SQL is a declarative language. When using the ` SELECT * FROM users WHERE id <= 100` query, we are expressing (or declaring) what we want: the first 100 users ever registered in the database. The way how these rows are retrieved is completely delegated to the SQL engine:\n- can it use an index to accelerate the query?\n- Should/Can it use multiple CPU cores to finish earlier?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From a developer's point of view, we have no idea how these data are actually retrieved.
